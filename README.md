SkyOS32
----------------

SkyOS32 is a 32-bit operating system under development in C ++ in a Visual Studio environment.
In general, the development of an operating system is not easy,
because the development platform is so inconvenient.
SkyOS32 allows you to build a kernel with only one Visual Studio IDE in a Windows environment.
Develop an operating system just as you would develop an application through SkyOS32.
